 tridentinism:0 "Tridentine"
 tridentinism_desc:0 "Called Tridentines due to their preservation of the ancient Tridentine Mass, the Tridentines follow what they consider the true, traditional, untainted form of Christianity. Originating from traditionalist Catholics who disagreed with the modernizing reforms of the late Roman Catholic Church, the adherents of Tridentinism believe that the Deluge was a punishment, divine retaliation to bring down those who lost sight of the Lord’s true path. This culminated with His Holiness, the Vicar of Christ, abandoning the Earth entirely. Tridentines believe that only a holy war against all infidels and heretics can cleanse the earth, paving the way for the Vicar to return and for God’s grace to come back into the Earth."
 liberationism:0 "Liberationism"
 liberationism_desc:0 "Based on the antediluvian teachings of Liberation Theology, Liberationists believe that good Christians must fight poverty and misery by addressing its alleged source, the sin of greed, which they denounce at every chance. Liberationists hold that the ancient hierarchies have been corrupted by greed and are leading their followers astray from God's path. Therefore, only base church communities comprised of self-reliant worshipers from amongst the common people can bring the church closer to the early uncorrupted gospel. Some of the more radical Liberationists believe that the blight of greed directly caused the Deluge, as society became Godless and the natural order was broken."
 apostolicism:0 "Apostolic"
 apostolicism_desc:0 "The "Igreja Católica Apostólica", or "Apostolic Catholic Church", split from mainstream Roman Catholicism long before the Event over disputes regarding divorce and clerical celibacy. It eventually became known for its relative tolerance of non-Christian faiths. After the chaos of the Deluge, the Apostolic Catholic Church absorbed most of the post-diluvian Catholic groups in Brazil and became the dominant Christian faith in most of the Empire, and this position was cemented further when it was adopted by the first post-Event Emperor of the House of Bragança, Pedro the Restorer. Most non-Brazilian Catholics reject the Apostolic Church as schismatic and borderline heretical."
 ciceritism:0 "Ciceritism"
 ciceritism_desc:0 "Devout followers of Father Cicero’s teachings and the works of other notable religious men from the Brazilian Northeast, Cicerites adhere to the Latin Rite, perform charity works, and follow special processions in Romaria. Both Cicerites and mainline Apostolics revere and praise the work of Cicero towards the church, but Cicerites have a particular reverence for his words."
 celestism:0 "Celestism"
 celestism_desc:0 "Celestes believe that the spirit of Christ descended upon a series of messianic figures from Southern Brazil, who guided His people to purity in the New World and against the deviant heretics who would have them exterminated. Celestes worship many messianic figures, including José Maria, Teodora and Maria Rosa. They believe that these figures were blessed with divine visions, and were thus chosen by divine providence to lead their followers in so-called “celestial communities”. Celestes often take inspiration from Old World traditions such as chivalry and chastity, shunning earthly pleasures and inflicting heavy punishment on deviants and enemies of the faith. Nevertheless, they often mix esoteric and mystic elements into their Christian doctrine, and Celestes have great respect for healers and miracle workers."
 cristero:0 "Cristero"
 cristero_desc:0 "La Iglesia Católica Cristera, or the Cristero Catholic Church, is a uniquely Mexican variety of Catholicism that survived after the Event and subsequently consolidated power. They are distinguished from other Catholic descended faiths by giving special focus to Our Lady of Guadalupe, Empress of the Americas and mother of Christ the King, alongside the Holy Trinity and the saints. They reject any attempt of establishing a new Papacy as heresy and claim that the Popes of old had given the Mexican Church Primature over the rest of the Catholic churches in the continent, and thus the Cristeros are charged with the protection of all the faithful in the Americas. In order to accomplish this task, all Holy and Lay Orders are placed under the command of the Prelate of Cristo Rey who, due to the continued absence of the Bishop of Rome, only answers to Cristo Rey himself."
 particularist_religion:0 "Particularist"
 particularist_religion_desc:0 "Particularists are heirs from the once by far dominant faith of the continent, Catholicism, which was battered by the chaos and the change brought by the Event. In need of greater unity and direction than ever, a union of archbishops of South America put their political differences aside and decided to unite as a sui iuris particular Catholic Church, and elected the Patriarch of South America to lead them. Originally based in Buenos Aires, the rise of other faiths has displaced the Patriarchy north of the Paraná, to Asunción. While the Particularists have maintained their Catholic Latin rites, traditional folk practices of the River Plate Basin have deeply permeated it. The autonomous ecclesiastical leadership has sanctioned many of its venerated local saints as canonical, as well as the devotions to Gauchito Gil, San La Muerte, and San Roque Gonzalez de Santa Cruz."
 ursuline:0 "Ursuline"
 ursuline_desc:0 "The Ursuline Church originated as an antediluvian religious order patronised by Saint Ursula. After the Deluge, most French-Canadian Catholics turned to the Ursuline Order for guidance in acknowledgment of the charitable works the Order had performed after the collapse. The Ursuline Order itself, loosely tied to the larger Catholic complex of the Americas, attended the Ecumenical Council of The Americas in the mid 22nd century. They advocated that the office of the Pope, and therefore all offices appointed by the Pope, would be considered empty until contact was restored with Rome. The current position of the Ursulines is that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession. However, members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until contact with the true Papacy is re-established."
 neopentecostalism:0 "Neo-Pentecostalism"
 neopentecostalism_desc:0 "Neo-Pentecostalism comprises the third wave of movements that coalesced together in the belief that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and faith healing, are still available to those who believe in Jesus Christ as their savior. While originally part of the South American Evangelical Convention alongside other churches, the Neo-Pentecostals rose to lead the Convention and cast out all denominations who denied their Apostolic Renewal, branding them heretics."
 anglican:0 "Anglican"
 anglican_desc:0 "Anglicanism describes itself as being a 'via media', or middle way, between Evangelical Protestantism and the Catholic Church. After the Deluge, the Anglican Church in the Caribbean refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the American South, instead becoming recognized as a separate faith unto itself. It soon became the dominant faith in much of the Anglophone Caribbean, as its tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices allowed it to serve as a unifying force for Christians in the area. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of the West Indies."
 moravian:0 "Moravian"
 moravian_desc:0 "Moravianism's roots lie in ancient Christian conflict. Moravians were originally a small branch of Protestantism that emphasized community, unity, and simple living; after the Deluge, many Miskitos saw the differences between religions as institutional rather than theological. This mindset sustained a spirit of unity among the Miskito, which continues to this day. United by a synod, Catholic, Protestant and Traditional beliefs came together to bring peace to the region. Believers experience divinity through dreams as well as through spirited discourses on the nature of good, evil, and the human spirit. Adherents, who call themselves brothers and sisters, are united in celebrations called Love Feasts held in honor of the Victorious Lamb."
 mormon:0 "Mormon"
 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a faith with its roots in the Midwest of Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith, its founder and first prophet. When he was 12, Smith saw a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all churches taught false doctrines and that the restoration of the gospel and the original church was soon to come. Later in life he recieved a series of visits from the Angel Moroni, an ancient Native American prophet. These culminated in his recieving of gold plates, which held the Book of Mormon, a record of the ancient Nephite and Lamanite civilizations, groups decended from Jews who were taken to the American continent by the Lord, and visited by Christ after his death. Attracting both a following and great controversy from his claims of divine revelation and recieving of new scripture, Smith's sect was forced to relocate multiple times. Following the assassination of Joseph Smith and his presumed heir, Hyrum Smith, in 1844, Brigham Young came out from the succession crisis the dominant leader, arguing the seniormost apostle was to become the next Prophet. Under his leadership, the controversial practice of polygamy was expanded, and the Mormons moved west, to Utah, and thrived in isolation. Political conflicts would see polygamy ended as a practice, however, and social changes led to the practice being looked down on by church members themselves. Unusual doctrines, such as belief that the Godhead is composed of not just three persons, but three distinct entities, belief in a continuing line of prophets, and practicing 'bapisms for the dead' for those who never had an LDS baptism, have led to Mormonism being seen as distint from its Nicene cousins."
 woolleyite:0 "Woolleyite"
 woolleyite_desc:0 "The Woolleyites are a Mormon sect that share a history with the LDS church of Brigham Young, up until the formal rejection of polygamy by the prophets Wilford Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith. John W. Woolley and his son, Lorin C Woolley, among others, believed that was evidence that the LDS church had rejected the eternal law of God by caving to political pressure, and claimed that Woodruff's predecessor, John Taylor, had ordained them apostles and charged them with preserving the true church. Woolleyites also claim, as doctrines and practices that were wrongly abandoned, the United Order, a communalistic program based on Joseph Smith's "law of consecration" of personal property to the church's ends, and the Adam-God doctrine, which alleges that Adam was the Father in the flesh much as Jesus Christ was the Son in the flesh. Unique among LDS splinters, the Woolleyites view their parent church as a legitimate organization -- simply mislead and distorted -- and await their return to the proper fold."
 strangite:0 "Strangite"
 strangite_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is an LDS sect claiming descent from the prophethood of James Strang, who alleged that prophetic succession from Joseph Smith required divine appointment, which he had recieved from an angel. As "King" of his church, Strang introduced further scripture, claiming to translate a small set of plates created by the ancient American king Rajah Manchou of Voree, and the Book of the Law of the Lord, a document proporting to record part of the law given to Moses and preseved in the sealed portion of the golden plates. Strangites are adoptionist, believing that Jesus was born to mortal parents but perordained to be the Savior and adopted as God's son at birth. Animal sacrifice is practiced as part of religious festivities, and polygamy is sustained as valid. The death of Strang and his lack of a successor left the Strangites leaderless and doomed to relative obscurity. The sect no longer actively proselytizes, believing the dispensation of the gospel to have closed with Strang's death, but they still accept those souls who will come to them."
 lamanite:0 "Lamanite"
 lamanite_desc:0 "Followers of the Prophet Joseph Smith have existed in Latin America for centuries. Lamanites firmly believe that the events described in the Book of Mormon happened in Mesoamerica, and that their ancestors were intimately involved with the events described in it. Lamanites cling tightly to their heritage, incorporating it into the structure of the foreign faith; their worship mixes traditional Mormon practice with the veneration of ancestors and exalted figures who were mistaken for gods in the distant past. An ancient prophecy holds that the Lamanites 'shall blossom as a rose', and they are keen to see its fulfillment."
 quadrine:0 "Quadrine"
 quadrine_desc:0 "Descended from the Church of Latter Day Saints, the Quadrines were founded in a revelation to an exiled bishop known as Feliz. The revelation of the restored gospel, spoke of treasures that were until then, hidden and forbidden. It promised access to the Latter Day Saints, as long as they upheld the principles of Love, Compassion and Acceptance. Revealing the whole truth, it also made clear the role of the Heavenly Mother as an equal part of the Godhead. The last mission of the Saints then became to share the good news with the most downtrodden of society, so they could know salvation too."
 anabaptist:0 "Old Order"
 anabaptist_desc:0 "The Old Order are a collection of groups of Conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Brethren, focused on separation from the outside or ‘English’ World, a principle of nonviolence, and plain living. These tenets make life after the apocalypse difficult and often quite short. Due to the religious violence and general chaos inherent to the post-Deluge social order, the Old Order has abandoned its former practice of absolute pacifism, but members still strive to avoid violent conflict whenever possible. Using violence in any context - even self-defense - is highly discouraged."
 peace_church:0 "Peace Church"
 peace_church_desc:0 "The term "Peace Church" was originally an umbrella term for any denomination of pacifist Christianity, including the Society of Friends, the Brethren, and even the Old Order. Now, the term Peace Church refers to the more worldly churches who believe isolation is unnecessary and that violence is acceptable in self-defense. This less radical line of reasoning, as well as their policy of religious tolerance, has led to great success in expanding the faith."
 muckerism:0 "Muckerism"
 muckerism_desc:0 "Muckers follow the teachings of Jacobina Mentz Maurer, a self-proclaimed Messiah that lived long before the Deluge. Jacobina had dreams that she claimed were divine visions. These visions told her that she was the “New Christ”, the “Manifestation of God”, and that she should lead her compatriots in Southern Brazil to a pure, holy life in the New World. Muckers shun earthly pleasures such as money, lust, drinking and smoking. Even though Muckers are often viewed as fanatics, they are far less morally fundamentalist than their Celeste cousins; they bless each other with kisses, maintain an all-female clergy, and feel no shame in showing their bodies as God made them or expressing their love to each other."
 insular_carribean:0 "Insular"
 insular_carribean_desc:1 "The Catholics of the Caribbean are unique among non-American Catholics for being in full communion with the Conclavian Catholic Church. In return for this recognition, the Conclavian Church allows the archdioceses of the Caribbean to operate with a great deal of autonomy and has recognized the validity of the "Caribbean Insular Rite", which was formalized by the churches of the Caribbean after the Deluge. The Caribbean Insular Rite amounts to almost a full canon unto itself, containing both functional law and local saints. Most lay practitioners trust that their bishops do their due diligence and consider their local traditions to be in line with mainstream Catholicism. Other Catholics would note that many Insular Christians venerate 'African saints' that are suspiciously similar to figures from other nearby religions."
 animism:0 "Ánimaism"
 animism_desc:0 "The Ánimaist Catholic Church is, as the name implies, descended from antediluvian Catholicism. While the Ánimaists have maintained their Catholic Latin rites, folk practices such as veneration of the souls, or “Ánimas”, of the tragically departed have become part of the traditional rites as well. This was done chiefly through the construction and maintenance of “Ánimitas”, small shrines they use to remember and venerate these souls. The devout reverence for these souls gave Ánimaists their name, as they believe that the souls, with their lives unfulfilled, serve as a bridge between the mortal and the divine, enabling them to intercede in the name of the faithful and cause miracles. While most shrines are dedicated to local souls, some Ánimas have gained large followings, being regarded as saintly, hallowed spirits that are willing to help the faithful far across the land. Among these are La Difunta Correa, San Balmaceda, and Ceferino Namuncurá. The Ánimaists were originally in communion with the Patriarch in Asunción, but as the Particularist states kept pushing for further power, the western South American churches left communion to establish their own autonomous patriarchs, lead as equals by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Santiago."
 divina_chicha:0 "Chichero"
 divina_chicha_desc:0 "Encompassing the liminal space between the Christian rites of the Catholic Church and the ancestral practices of the Peruvian Andes, Divina Chica encompasses the diverse set of beliefs, practices and venerated folk saints and heroes of this area. These popular rites have emerged as a faith that stretches its original roots, expressed through the practice of great celebrations, dance, and music which connect the divine and the material worlds. Adherents to the Divina Chicha venerate great saints such as Chacalón, the Angel of the Poor; La Sarita Colonia, Patron of the Outcast; and Beatita de Humay. The most distinctive of its syncretic practices is the taking of Memento Mori, such as the bones of those who have passed away, for they believe the spirits of the dead can grant blessings and protection."
 pentecostalism:0 "Pentecostalism"
 pentecostalism_desc:0 "Pentecostalism is a branch of Protestant Christianity that is distinguished by Continuationism, or the belief that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, including miraculous blessings such as speaking in tongues and faith healing, are available to all those who believe in Jesus Christ as their savior. Classical Pentecostals are still close to most other Protestants with regards to church structure and religious doctrine; their influence and contact led other Christians to embrace Continuationism and become "Charismatic". After the Deluge, South American Pentecostals banded together with other Protestants in the Evangelical Convention of South America. However, after the Neo-Pentecostals tried to subvert and take control of the Convention, many member churches left in protest. The Classical Pentecostals who left the Convention were themselves cast out of the wider Non-Conformist movement, and the Pentecostals now stand on their own."

 israelite_desc:0 "The Evangelical Association of the Israelites Mission of the New Universal Pact, or Israelites, are a Christian faith founded in Peru in antediluvian times by the prophet Ezequiel Ataucusi Gamonal. They see themselves as the new people of Israel, a restoration of the old Kingdom of Israel in the far east. Likewise, Ezequiel is seen as the Christ of the West, a reincarnation of Jesus, the Christ of the East. They believe that Israel was born in Cusco, but its people disobeyed God's laws, and became distanced from God. Yet this alliance remained, and with the help of the Holy Spirit the Inca built Machu Pichu, and ruled by the grace of God. Now, at the end of days, God will soon come to judge mankind, but will spare the people of the privileged place of Peru and grant heaven on Earth to the Israelite faithful. Adherents practice strict biblical literalism, wearing only clothes described in The Bible, and growing their hair and beards long."
 united_church:0 "United Church"
 united_church_desc:0 "Originally one of the many offshoots of Protestant Christianity in Toronto, the United Church differs from its fellows by its belief that the Holy Spirit acts through all faiths, and that God’s will therefore be best understood through dialogue with other creeds. Through inter-faith services, adherents invite members of other faiths into their holy spaces to perform their own rituals, so as to open new pathways to the divine. The Church retains many elements of traditional Protestant Christianity, believing that the Bible is God’s most direct revelation to humankind, and that Communion is a holy act."
 penitents:0 "Penitente"
 penitents_desc:0 "Penitents take their name from their belief that the world has been given a second chance at redemption following the Deluge. This redemption can be achieved by performing physically demanding rituals which demonstrate the sorrow and regret that worshipers feel at their past sins. While these rituals were once performed only on Easter, Penitents believe that, since the Deluge, every week has become Holy. These acts of penitence can be as small as praying with their faces to the floor and as large as serving as pallbearers to enormous images depicting the passion of Christ. These rituals are often organized by brotherly associations called Moradas, which also serve as sanctuaries and stops along the weekly procession."

These first truth came from Jesus, and warned that God had decided to punish the natives for their sinful ways, their drunkeness, and their hubris. The second truth came from Mary, offering a second chance through Besiko's stewardship. This new covanent was sealed over an ancient flag, a relic once born by now forgotten gods who had once protected the green zone that was America. Under the rule of Besiko, the divine message proclaimed, the Church was to be abolished, and the meek would serve as wardens of the new law forevermore."

Incorporating various traditions that predate the arrival of missionaries, the Catholicism practiced by these people has always had slight variations from other churches.  The upheaval of the Event has exaggerated these changes even more - though they still retain close ties with their fellow Christian faithful. Most notably, the Grand Council has also taken the mantle of religious leadership, serving as the clergy for their people. Saint Anne, known to the Nnu a'sutmamg as Se'ta'n, also plays a greater role in the faith, regarded as the 'Grandmother of the Faithful.'"

A solution was eventually found, a treaty signed by the Archbishop of Peru transferred his spiritual responsibilities to the refounded office of the Willaq Umu. This bizarre form of legal succession has managed to create a syncretic and eclectic form of Christianity; one viewed with suspicion by both the Inti and other Christians, but also one that has so far managed to keep a fragile harmony within Incan society."

 redemptionist_desc:0 "The Evangelical Council was created by the Emperor to serve the Empire, and as such could never have served the purpose of moral guide and guardian that it claimed; this is the line of thought that justified the creation of the Redemptionist sect. They demand a strict primacy of church over state in a way often compared to a shepherd leading his flock, including the destruction of heresy and heathenry, the “wolves” of spirituality, regardless of whether it is within the heart of the poorest peasant or the richest king. Conversely, they also demand the church only focus on the spiritual, believing that having them deal with the particulars of governance will encourage lenience when dealing with the politically powerful."

Its origins lie more than a millennia ago, when the teachings of Yoi missionaries blended with the traditions from time immemorial of the ancient Cahíta. New saints and ancient spirits mingled and merged like a mirage in the northern heat. Only the Cahíta were blessed by Liós and his spirits to understand the existence, they are the ones who really know what is to live with a foot juxtaposed in each world, and to harmonize with the many layers of the universe through dance and prayer.

These disparate beliefs condensed over the years into La Fraternidad Esotérica de los Limpios or the Esoteric Fraternity of the Limpios, which was formally founded after the Council of Catemaco in the early 23rd century. The Limpios worship a pantheon of quasi-deities derived from folk saints and heroes of the past who ultimately serve God but are powerful in their own right. Spiritual entities can be called upon for guidance and communed with through ritual means, but only the most worthy of are blessed by the heavens and allow themselves to become possessed, a Cajita, by the saints and spirits to perform miracles and act as conduits to allow these divine entities to once more directly influence the world they once roamed as mortals."

Navegantes firmly believe that those who deny the prophets’ words and do not follow the teachings those prophets gave to their ancient tribes, are nothing but heretics or infidels that should make way for the new Chosen People, the Waves of Men.

Curanderos use Her gift to siphon life from plants, eggs and water to help other people, but Nahuales siphon life from animals and even human beings to collect unnatural powers and bring harm to their enemies.

This ritual altar is an iron pot that contains sticks, herbs, fetishes, and most importantly, human bones. These bones are chosen by the Nfumbi, the spirit of a dead person that is binded and enslaved by a priest. The Nganga has to be continually fed with blood from male creatures to keep its magic alive.

This culture of beach recreation has lead to a particular indulgence in the sport of surfing, which is valued among the Gnarlists not only for its connection to the ocean, but for its skill, and athleticism. The sea does not only provide recreational and spiritual benefits for the Gnarlists, but gives them the resources and nourishment to survive. Coastal Gnarlists subside in large parts on the gifts of the ocean, fishing and aquaculture being common.

This has led them to develop not only a deep connection to the sacred Cerrado, but also a strong communal identity, based on the loyalty to their clans and families - which, on the other hand, makes them cautious of outsiders who might threaten their way of life.

In the same manner, they believe life is a journey, divided in a trip away and a trip home, La Ida and La Vuelta. As such they believe young men are encouraged to make mistakes and be violent, while as they age they must learn from these misdeeds to pass on deeper knowledge to their descendants.
